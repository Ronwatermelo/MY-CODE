THE CODE FOR THE SIMULATION OF CHLORIDE DIFFUSION OF CAPC  UNDER SALT FROST CONDITION

Corresponding file
1. CAPC-0% file corresponds to the CAPC-0%, including mesh division, chloride ion diffusion coefficient modifications, and element settings, allowing for detailed generation of chloride ion diffusion under different salt frost cycles.
2. CAPC-0%-C-20 file differs from the above file by using circular aggregates, with coarse aggregates comprising 20%.
3. CAPC-0%-C-40 file also differs from the previous file by using circular aggregates, with coarse aggregates comprising 40%.
4. CAPC-0%-M-20 file distinguishes itself by using polygonal aggregates, with coarse aggregates comprising 20%.
5. CAPC-1% file corresponds to the CAPC-1%, including mesh division, chloride ion diffusion coefficient modifications, and element settings, allowing for detailed generation of chloride ion diffusion under different salt frost cycles.
6. CAPC-2% file corresponds to the CAPC-2%, including mesh division, chloride ion diffusion coefficient modifications, and element settings, allowing for detailed generation of chloride ion diffusion under different salt frost cycles.
7. CAPC-4% file corresponds to the CAPC-4%, including mesh division, chloride ion diffusion coefficient modifications, and element settings, allowing for detailed generation of chloride ion diffusion under different salt frost cycles.
8. CAPC-8% file corresponds to the CAPC-8%, including mesh division, chloride ion diffusion coefficient modifications, and element settings, allowing for detailed generation of chloride ion diffusion under different salt frost cycles.
